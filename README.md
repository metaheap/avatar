I find the 13 root DNS servers a facinating concept so I wanted to somehow incorperate that into the design. `J` happens to be the 10th letter while `S` happens to be the 19th letter. I wanted to use 13 which would probably be a more accurate representation of that but instead opted for a letter that represents my interests a bit more.
